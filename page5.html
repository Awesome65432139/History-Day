    <div class="page5div">
      <p>The lasting effects of the Wright Brothers work includes reveloutionizing travel, trade, and the military. First Travel was reveloutionized by allowing for a reasonablle price you can fly across the world with little effort, before you would have to drive for days, take a boat and then continue driving, instead of taking one half a day flight. Second, trade was transformed by speeding up delivery of goods between states, countries, and even continents in a matter of days. Finally, the militray was affected dramatically, and has been used in war since the 1911 Italo-Turkish War, including both World Wars.</p>
