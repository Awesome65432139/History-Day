    <h1>What started this?</h1>
    <div class="page5div">
      <p>The lasting effects of the Wright Brothers work includes revolutionizing travel, trade, and the military. First Travel was revolutionized by enabling the possibility to fly across the world with little effort, before you would have to drive for days, take a boat and then continue driving, instead of taking one half a day flight. Second, trade was transformed by speeding up delivery of goods between states, countries, and even continents in a matter of days. Finally, the military was affected dramatically, and has been used in war since the 1911 Italo-Turkish War, including both World Wars.</p>
