    <h1>What Did They Do?</h1>
    <div class="page1div">
      <p>The Wright Brothers were responsible for making the first working powered heavier than air flight machine later called a airplane. They innovated off of other engineers work. They did this by focusing on wings and aerodynamics over other components whereas other people had mainly focused on the motor instead of the actual part that makes flight possible.</p>
